# Pavement Rutting Progression Analysis

## Project Overview
This is a **self-initiated project** analyzing the relationship between cumulative traffic load and rut depth in asphalt pavements.  
The goal is to demonstrate data analysis and modeling skills relevant to pavement performance evaluation.

---

## Objectives
- Simulate a small dataset of **traffic load (ESALs)** vs. **rut depth (mm)**.
- Apply **linear regression** to model rut depth growth.
- Visualize rut progression with scatter plots and regression line.

---

## Tools & Libraries
- **R / MATLAB / Python** (depending on implementation)
- **Data Handling & Simulation**: vectors, random noise generation
- **Modeling**: Linear Regression
- **Visualization**: scatter plots and regression line

## Project Structure

## Key Results
- **Linear regression equation:**  
  `Rut Depth = 2.08 + 0.00039 * Traffic Load`

- The regression line shows a **positive correlation**: rut depth increases gradually with cumulative traffic.

- Visualization: Scatter plot of observed rut depths and fitted regression line.
