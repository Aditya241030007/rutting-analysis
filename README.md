# Pavement Rutting Progression Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **self-initiated project** analyzing the relationship between cumulative traffic load and rut depth in asphalt pavements.  
The goal is to demonstrate data analysis and modeling skills relevant to pavement performance evaluation.

---

## ⚙️ Objectives
- Simulate a small dataset of **traffic load (ESALs)** vs. **rut depth (mm)**.
- Apply **linear regression** to model rut depth growth.
- Visualize rut progression with scatter plots and regression line.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **R / MATLAB / Python** (depending on implementation)
- **Data Handling & Simulation**: vectors, random noise generation
- **Modeling**: Linear Regression
- **Visualization**: scatter plots and regression line
